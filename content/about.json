  "bio_p1": "I am **passionate, driven, self-taught**. An art director and designer from Birmingham, Alabama, with more than 16 years of experience. Prior to my career as a designer, I spent formative years in an apprenticeship that led to a job as a sushi chef at Birmingham's most treasured Japanese restaurant. Oddly enough, creating sushi profoundly influenced my eye for composition and harmony.",
  "bio_p2": "I also devoted much of my time to graffiti art — concepting murals, sketching plans and color schematics, hosting and collaborating with other painters for **Writer's Block**, an annual graffiti event sponsored by Red Bull. That work impressed upon me the importance and impact of considerate design and collaborative process.",
  "bio_p3": "Throughout my professional design years, I've cultivated a deftness for **typography, lettering, logos, and branding**. I enjoy designing with intent through strategic collaboration and problem solving. I believe in a client-centric teamwork approach paired with discipline, restraint, and a thorough understanding of design trends and history.",
  "bio_p4": "Great design doesn't arise from linear effort. It requires a dynamic journey — collaboration, research, more collaboration, refinement, coffee, more refinement. It defies process. And in the end, it must serve the client well. It must create success.",
  "outside": "**Smoking and curing meats**, cooking all genres of cuisine, and sharing those meals with friends over cold beers. Presently, my labor of love."
