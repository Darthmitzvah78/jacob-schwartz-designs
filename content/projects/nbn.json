  "description": "Nut Butter Nation is a Tennessee-based maker of **all-natural, non-GMO, locally sourced nut butters**. The identity system was built around the product itself — each label uses a base colour derived from the flavour-defining ingredient, creating a cohesive line where every SKU is instantly distinguishable but unmistakably part of the same family."
