  "description": "In 2014, The Cultural Alliance of Birmingham set out to **expand their mission for the creative industries** in the community. Create Birmingham was the result — a new identity built to rally artists, makers, and culture-builders across the city under a single banner. The brand launch included a full identity system, print collateral, web design, and a citywide event to bring it all to life."
