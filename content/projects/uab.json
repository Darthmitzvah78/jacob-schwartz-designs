  "description": "A large-scale campaign for the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, built around a single idea: **every person in that building is part of the team** — from kitchen staff to surgeons. The concept framed the entire workforce as a partnership of heroes. Delivered as 40+ elevator wraps, campaign posters, and social media content across the hospital campus."
